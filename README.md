# Warehouse-Management

This project is a GUI application developed using Java Swing, designed and implemented in order to improve the processing of orders and products available inside a warehouse. In other words, it is an application designed to automate both the processing of orders from customers (including the creation of the receipt) and the updating of the menu and products available in the warehouse.

The main purpose was to get acquainted with working with the database. Both learning the connection with the database and processing all the information it offers us. From the beginning, we work with visualizing the information, adding new information, updating and deleting information.\
WarehouseDB, the database used to store the data, was created with MySQL and contains three tables: Clients, Orders, and Products.

Usage of layered architecture patter, reflection technique (used for creating a generic class that contains the methods for accessing the database) and Javadoc for the documentation of the classes and their methods.
